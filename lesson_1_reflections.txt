How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

line marked with + for new lines
line marked with - for deleted lines

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
changes on a feature or bug must be in one commit with good comment. this makes it easy for the history

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows all commit, every commit has an id. with this id you can compare this commit an you can see what is new or deleted in the file

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
use for all my private and public code projet including ps1 emulator
