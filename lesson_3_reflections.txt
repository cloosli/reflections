When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
if you work on multiple devices, or in a team or just as backup in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you have local changes, you have to merge the files and you can see what others have done in the repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks is ah shortcut from GutHub, it clones a repository in yours. Branches makes a new graph / fork parallel to the master. User forks on GitHub and clone to create a completly new repo. Use branches if you want commit the branch back to the master.
