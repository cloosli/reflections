When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
if you work on multiple devices, or in a team or just as backup in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you have local changes, you have to merge the files and you can see what others have done in the repo.
